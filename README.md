## About The Project

This project is made to exhibit all that I have learned about early intermediate HTML, CSS, and JS from the previous months. It emulates the basic functionalities of a commercial website, including:

* Product Lookup
* Kart Management System
* Signup/Login System

Notable functions made for this project are the:
* "drag-to-move" Product Display
* Product Filter Mechanism

## Built With

This project is done without any Bootstrap, SASS, or external APIs. Resources aside from the images and fonts used are unique.

## Getting Started

Visit the following link for the project demonstration. Note that it automatically creates localStorage items since it does not operate with any database.
